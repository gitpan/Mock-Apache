NOTES
=====

Dispatching to handlers
-----------------------

Initially just call specified handler, but could have list of handlers
or even discover from config file.


Sending data
------------

stdout is tied to mod_perl (I think - is this just in content
handler?)  Need to tie - possibly using IO::String - tie to $r->{_output}

$r->send_http_header grabs the status and headers and sends them - no
further setting of headers is possible after that.


Client disconnect
-----------------

Could count method calls and allow a disconnect_after option, which
takes a hash of method=>count pairs - on each method update its count
and flag disconnect when that count reaches the threshold
